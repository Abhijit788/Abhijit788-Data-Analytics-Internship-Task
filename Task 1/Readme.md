*Descriptoin*:The task involves analyzing NYC Yellow Taxi Trip data using Python data analysis tools. The code downloads the dataset from Kaggle using kagglehub, processes it using Dask for efficient handling of large datasets, and performs exploratory data analysis. Key operations include data cleaning by removing null values, calculating summary statistics, and analyzing trip patterns based on passenger counts. The analysis specifically focuses on computing and visualizing the relationship between passenger count and average trip distance. The processed data is saved for future use, and results are visualized using matplotlib to create a bar chart showing trip distance trends.

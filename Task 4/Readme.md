*Descriptoin*:This code performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer. It begins by downloading a dataset of Amazon product reviews using KaggleHub, then processes the data using Dask for efficient handling of large datasets. The code analyzes the sentiment of each review text, classifying them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on compound sentiment scores. It uses NLTK's VADER lexicon for sentiment calculation and visualizes the distribution of sentiments using matplotlib. Finally, it saves the analyzed data with sentiment labels to a CSV file.
The code demonstrates practical application of natural language processing for analyzing customer feedback and sentiment in e-commerce reviews.

*Descriptoin*:This task involves building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict median housing values using the California Housing dataset. The workflow includes loading the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA) via a correlation heatmap, and defining features and the target variable. The dataset is then split into training and test sets. A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the data, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² metrics. Finally, the results are visualized through a scatter plot and a line chart comparing actual vs. predicted values, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness and predictive capability.
